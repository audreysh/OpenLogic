The most convenient way to report a typo should reference the file and line number where the typo occurs:

- Find the file in the content tree: https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic/tree/master/content
- Click on the line number; then on the menu indicated by three horizontal dots
- Select "Copy permalink" and paste that link below.

Alternatively describe the location of the typo (page #, "after Theorem 5.1", etc., and *mention which PDF you are referencing*)
